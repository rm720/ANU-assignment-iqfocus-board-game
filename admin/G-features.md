    Implements interesting starting challenges (Task 11)
    (All tasks 1-11)

    Difficulty levels really depend on the number of existing solutions, i.e. if the challenge has 18 solutions it is easier to solve than the one with a unique solution.
    We found all solvable possible challenges, there are about 6000, game keeps the challenge library in the file and searches through when needed.
    The style of original IQ-focus board game is preserved, i.e.
    Preserved authentic transparent lid which makes the original board game more interactive and recognisable.
    Remarkable Background canvas is taken straight from the original smart games website,
    Shades of colours in graphics maintain the unique tint as the original board game,  which pleases the eyes and reminds of the good touch feeling when holding that cute box.

    Tile expand and contract during the dragging which enhances the game entertainment component.
    Reverse tile placement is done by simple click simplifies mouse operation and helps to focus on the puzzle.
    Help button provides an explanation of the game rules, goal and controls.
    Colours and shades are chosen to achieve mind pacifying effect.
    All shapes prevailingly smoothened for relaxing player's eyes and outstanding experience.
